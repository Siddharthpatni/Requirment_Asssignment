## Contents

This repository contains assignments and exercises for the Requirements Engineering course:

### Exercise 04: E-Scooter Ride-Share System (Agent-Oriented Modeling)
- **File:** [Solution_Exercise_04_Goal_Model.md](Solution_Exercise_04_Goal_Model.md)
- **Description:** Agent-oriented modeling solution including agents/roles identification, functional and quality goals, pricing model, and behavioral interface model (BIM) for an E-Scooter ride-sharing system.

### Exercise 05: Petri Net - File Locking Mechanism
- **File:** [exercise5.py](exercise5.py)
- **Description:** Python implementation of a Petri Net modeling a file locking mechanism using inhibitor arcs. Simulates concurrent read/write access with proper locking semantics.
- **Simulation Results:** PNG images showing different states of the Petri Net simulation (Initial state, reading, writing, blocking scenarios, etc.)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- SNAKES library (Petri Net modeling)
- Graphviz (visualization)
- Mermaid (diagrams in markdown)

## Running the Petri Net Simulation

```bash
python exercise5.py
```

This will generate a series of PNG images showing the simulation steps.
